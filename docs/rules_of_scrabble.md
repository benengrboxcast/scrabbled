# Rules of Scrabble

## Game Overview
Scrabble is a word game for 2-4 players where players score points by placing tiles bearing a single letter onto a game board divided into a 15×15 grid of squares. The tiles must form words that, in crossword fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns, and be included in a standard dictionary.

## Equipment
- **Game Board**: 15×15 grid of squares
- **Letter Tiles**: 100 tiles total with letters and point values
- **Tile Racks**: One per player to hold 7 tiles
- **Score Pad**: To track points
- **Timer**: Optional, for tournament play

## Board Layout

### Grid Structure
The Scrabble board is a 15×15 square grid (225 squares total). The center square (marked with a star ★) is where the first word must be played.

#### Position Labeling System
Board positions are labeled using a coordinate system:
- **Columns**: Labeled A through O (left to right)
- **Rows**: Numbered 1 through 15 (top to bottom)
- **Center Square**: Position H8 (column H, row 8)

Examples of position notation:
- A1 = Top-left corner
- O15 = Bottom-right corner  
- H8 = Center star square
- A15 = Bottom-left corner
- O1 = Top-right corner

### Premium Squares
The board contains premium squares that multiply letter or word scores:

#### Triple Word Score (TWS) - Red Squares
- Located at corners and strategic positions
- Multiplies the entire word score by 3
- Positions: A1, A8, A15, H1, H15, O1, O8, O15

#### Double Word Score (DWS) - Pink/Light Red Squares  
- Multiplies the entire word score by 2
- Forms diagonal patterns across the board
- 17 squares total including the center star
- Positions: B2, C3, D4, E5, H8 (center star), K5, L4, M3, N2, B14, C13, D12, E11, K11, L12, M13, N14

#### Triple Letter Score (TLS) - Dark Blue Squares
- Multiplies the letter placed on it by 3
- 12 squares positioned strategically around the board
- Positions: B6, B10, F2, F6, F10, F14, J2, J6, J10, J14, N6, N10

#### Double Letter Score (DLS) - Light Blue Squares
- Multiplies the letter placed on it by 2
- 24 squares distributed across the board
- Positions: A4, A12, C7, C9, D1, D8, D15, G3, G7, G9, G13, H4, H12, I3, I7, I9, I13, L1, L8, L15, M7, M9, O4, O12

### Board Symmetry
The premium squares are arranged symmetrically, creating identical patterns in all four quadrants.

## Letter Distribution and Point Values

| Letter | Quantity | Point Value |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| A, E, I, O, U, L, N, S, T, R | 1 each | 1 point |
| D, G | 2 each | 2 points |
| B, C, M, P | 2 each | 3 points |
| F, H, V, W, Y | 2 each | 4 points |
| K | 1 | 5 points |
| J, X | 1 each | 8 points |
| Q, Z | 1 each | 10 points |
| Blank | 2 | 0 points |

**Total: 100 tiles**

## Game Setup

1. **Choose First Player**: Each player draws one tile. Player with letter closest to 'A' goes first. Return tiles to bag.

2. **Draw Tiles**: Each player draws 7 tiles and places them on their rack.

3. **First Play**: The first player must create a word that covers the center star square (H8).

## How to Play

### Taking a Turn
On each turn, a player must either:
1. **Play a word** by placing tiles on the board
2. **Exchange tiles** by returning tiles to the bag and drawing new ones
3. **Pass** their turn (rarely beneficial)

### Playing Words

#### Word Placement Rules
- All tiles played in a single turn must be placed in the same row or column
- All tiles must be connected (no gaps between letters)
- At least one new tile must be adjacent to a tile already on the board (except for the first play)
- All letter combinations formed must create valid words

#### Valid Words
- Must be found in a standard dictionary
- No proper nouns, abbreviations, or words requiring apostrophes or hyphens
- Foreign words that have entered English usage are allowed

### Scoring

#### Basic Scoring
- Add the point values of all letters in words formed during your turn
- Premium squares only count when a tile is first placed on them
- If a word covers multiple premium squares, apply all bonuses

#### Word Multipliers
- Apply letter multipliers first, then word multipliers
- If a play creates multiple words, score each word separately
- Word multipliers apply to the entire word score

#### Special Scoring Rules
- **Using all 7 tiles** in one turn: +50 point bonus (called a "bingo")
- **Blank tiles**: Worth 0 points but can represent any letter
- Once placed, blank tiles cannot be changed

### Examples of Scoring

**Example 1**: Playing "QUIZ" with Q on a Triple Letter Score
- Q (10) × 3 = 30 points
- U (1) + I (1) + Z (10) = 12 points  
- Total: 42 points

**Example 2**: Playing "WORD" across a Double Word Score
- W (4) + O (1) + R (1) + D (2) = 8 points
- 8 × 2 = 16 points total

## Special Rules

### Blank Tiles
- Can represent any letter when played
- Player must declare what letter it represents
- Cannot be changed once played
- Worth 0 points

### Challenging Words
- Any player may challenge a word immediately after it's played
- If the word is invalid, the challenger wins and the word is removed
- If the word is valid, the challenger loses their next turn
- Use an official dictionary to resolve challenges

### Exchanging Tiles
- Player may return any number of tiles to the bag
- Draw the same number of new tiles
- Turn ends; no points scored
- Cannot exchange if fewer than 7 tiles remain in the bag

### End of Game

#### Game Ends When:
1. A player uses all their tiles and the bag is empty, OR
2. All players pass twice in succession

#### Final Scoring:
- Players subtract the sum of their remaining tiles from their score
- If a player used all tiles, they add the sum of all other players' remaining tiles to their score

## Strategy Tips

### High-Scoring Strategies
1. **Target Premium Squares**: Especially Triple Word Scores with high-value letters
2. **Create Multiple Words**: Form several words in one play for maximum points
3. **Save Good Letters**: Keep high-value letters for premium square opportunities
4. **Learn Short High-Value Words**: QI, XU, ZA, etc.

### Defensive Play
1. **Block Premium Squares**: Prevent opponents from accessing Triple Word Scores
2. **Manage the Board**: Control openings and closing opportunities
3. **Tile Management**: Maintain a balanced rack of vowels and consonants

### Common Two-Letter Words
Memorizing valid two-letter words is crucial for connecting plays:
- AA, AB, AD, AE, AG, AH, AI, AL, AM, AN, AR, AS, AT, AW, AX, AY
- BA, BE, BI, BO, BY
- And many more...

## Tournament Rules

### Time Limits
- 25 minutes per player per game in official tournaments
- Players may use chess clocks to track individual time

### Tile Tracking
- Players may keep track of tiles played
- Tile tracking sheets are often provided in tournaments

### Word Verification
- Tournament directors have official word lists
- Electronic devices may be used for word verification

## Variations

### Team Scrabble
- Players work in partnerships
- Partners sit across from each other
- May consult with partner before making plays

### Speed Scrabble
- Shorter time limits per turn
- Often 1-2 minutes per turn

### Duplicate Scrabble
- All players receive identical tiles
- Scoring based on finding the highest-scoring play
- Used in some tournaments
